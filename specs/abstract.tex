\begin{abstract}
  This document describes the format for Global Alliance for Genomics
  and Health (GA4GH) encrypted and authenticated files.
  % 
  Encryption helps to prevent accidental disclosure of confidential
  information.
  % 
  Allowing programs to directly read and write data in an encrypted
  format reduces the chance of such disclosure.
  % 
  The format can be used to encrypt any underlying file format
  % 
  and allows for seeking on the encrypted data.
  %
  In particular, indexes on the plain text version can also be used on
  the encrypted file without modifications.
